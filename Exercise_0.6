EXERCISE 0.6 =>
New sequence diagram:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 201 Created
    deactivate server
    
    Note right of server: The server responses with the state 201 Created, to confirm that it recieved the new note and implemented it in the JSON file.
    
    Note right of browser: The browser only makes one request beacuse the web is a SPA, so instead of making the requests to the server, like when the page is load, it just uses the JavaScript code obtained from the website.
